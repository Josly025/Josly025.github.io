# Code Refactor 

## Details:
* The code in index.hmtml was modified to include better use of semantic html elements. This 
inlcuded changing many div tages to other sematic tags when needed. 
* Many in-tag classes, id's, and more semantics were changed in index.html to link with a style.css file. 
* Main goal was to reduce the amount of CSS and refractor where needed. Most importantly; making sure that the 
page remains the same as it orignally is viewed in a web browser. 

### Notes on Process: 
* I was first confused on what exactly we were to do with the Semantic elements of the work; however, 
I noticed a few DIV tags that could be changed afer reviewing my notes. 
* I found it easy to use cmd + / and cmd + z throughout the refractoring process. I found it easy to 
see various aspects of CSS that could fall into one section or could be combined into one class. I became 
more confident as my changed continued to NOT change the browser link. 
* For the future, I did not know when to stop attempting to make elements. I spent a lot
of time on trying to trying various new elements; however, I started to consider if more would 
potentially hurt my grade. I also think I could get better at organizing my file system with GitHub 
for future projects. Potentially, I would make a better repo name to pair with the files.
